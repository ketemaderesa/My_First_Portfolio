## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project, titled **"My First Portfolio"**, is a beginner-friendly web development assignment designed to help me learn and practice the fundamentals of HTML5 without using any frameworks or libraries.

It consists of two main parts:

1. **html_basic** â€“ A series of basic HTML pages demonstrating valid HTML structure, usage of semantic tags, text formatting, image linking, embedded content (such as tweets), internal navigation, and data tables.
2. **portfolio** â€“ A fully structured and semantically correct personal portfolio webpage that includes sections such as Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact, with internal navigation links and external social links (LinkedIn, GitHub).

### ðŸŒŸ Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and use proper HTML document structure
- Write clean, valid, and W3C-compliant HTML code
- Create multi-page websites using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Use hyperlinks, images, embedded content, tables, and email links
- Build a basic personal portfolio site to showcase projects and contact information
